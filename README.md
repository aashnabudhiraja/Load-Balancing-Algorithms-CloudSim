# **A Performance Comparison of Load Balancing Algorithms on a Simulated Cloud**

The following load balancing algorithms are implemented:<br/>
➢ Round Robin Algorithm<br/>
➢ Weighted Round Robin Algorithm<br/>
➢ Threshold Based Algorithm<br/>
➢ Honey Bee Foraging Algorithm<br/>
➢ Ant Colony Optimization<br/>

To compare the performance of different algorithms under the same configurations on the following metrics using a cloud simulator:<br/>
➢ Server Response Time<br/>
➢ Data Center Processing Time<br/>

Tool used: **CloudAnalyst**<br/>
CloudAnalyst is an Open-Source CloudSim based tool for modelling and analysis of large scale
cloud computing environments. It allows configuration of application workloads such as number
of resources in each data center, geographic location of data centers, number of users, etc. It
provides information such as request processing time, response time metrics etc.

Language used: Java<br/>
Underlying framework: CloudSim
